by default, the HTML <input type="date"> uses the browser’s locale, which often shows mm/dd/yyyy (especially on US settings).
Would you like me to make the “Pay & Book” button show a temporary loading spinner (e.g., “Processing...”) for 2 seconds before showing the success toast? It gives a more natural user experience flow.
Would you like me to help you add admin session persistence (so admins stay logged in even after refreshing or reopening the browser)?
Would you like me to add email or WhatsApp notification sending (e.g., after a booking is saved, send confirmation automatically)? It can easily integrate here next.
